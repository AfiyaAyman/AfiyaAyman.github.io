This project aims to develop a data-driven energy prediction and optimization framework for multi-modal transit agencies. The framework is designed to predict the energy consumption of electric, diesel and hybrid buses and optimize the energy consumption of the entire fleet. The framework is evaluated using real-world data from the Chattanooga Area Regional Transportation Authority (CARTA). The results show that the framework can predict the energy consumption of transit buses with high accuracy and optimize the energy consumption of the entire fleet with significant energy savings. The framework can be used by other transit agencies to reduce their energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.
