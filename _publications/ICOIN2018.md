## Abstract
Gliomas are brain tumors starting in the glial
cells. Gliomas can be low grade (slow growing) or high
grade (fast growing). Physicians use the grade of a brain
tumor based on gliomas to decide which treatment a
patient needs. The condition of the tumor is of vital
importance for the treatment. In this paper, we propose a
computerized system to differentiate between normal
brain and abnormal brain with tumor in the MRI images
and also further classify the abnormal brain tumors into
HGG or LGG tumors. The proposed computerized system
uses k-means as the segmentation technique for clustering
whilst Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) are the main parts of the
feature extraction and feature reduction mechanisms,
respectively. Support vector machine (SVM) is a major
part of our proposed system as it classifies the abnormal
brain tumors in the LGG and HGG after the extraction
and reduction of the features.
