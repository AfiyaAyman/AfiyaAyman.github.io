## üñ•Ô∏è Featured Projects

### 1. **Automated Multi-Task Machine Learning for Ridership Prediction of Public Transportation Routes**
- **Overview:** 
  - Proposed an efficient affinity-driven MTL framework that pre-selects task groups to maximize MTL performance gains. 
  - Achieved **15% lower prediction error** than single-task models and **~7% MSE improvement over baseline MTL grouping methods**. Validated on real-world public transit ridership data, demonstrating consistent performance gains across task groups.
- **Skills:** Python, Tensorflow, Keras, Numpy, Scipy, Scikit-learn

### 2. **Data-Driven Energy Optimization for Multi-Modal Transit Agencies**
- **Overview:** 

[//]: # (  - Designed a predictive framework for optimizing energy consumption across various transit vehicle types. This system minimizes fuel and electricity use while enabling optimal vehicle-to-trip assignments and charging schedules.)
  - Designed and developed a framework for predicting energy consumption for various transit vehicle types using multi-month sensor data, outperforming classic learning algorithms (decision trees and linear regression) by **~ 33% in MSE reduction**. 
  - Achieved **<5% prediction error** for 6-hour trips, by aggregating sample-level predictions across time-series segments. 
  - Built a decision tree‚Äìbased map-matching module linking noisy GPS to road geometry with **90% accuracy**, enabling elevation and distance features. 
  - Models trained on multi-month, multi-vehicle telemetry data (6 vehicle types across 8 months); prediction outcomes informed energy-aware routing and scheduling strategies for transit agencies in Tennessee. 
  - Integrated into a distributed ML pipeline for real-time energy prediction

- **Skills:** Python, Tensorflow, Keras, Numpy, Scikit-learn

### 3. **Neural Architecture and Feature Search for Predicting Public Transit Ridership**
- **Overview:**
  - Developed a neural architecture and feature search framework for route-specific ridership prediction using Automatic Passenger Count and weather data - **jointly optimizing prediction error and model complexity** 
  - Evaluated on real-world transit ridership data across ten routes, showing that route-specific neural network architectures and features outperform generally optimized models in prediction accuracy **(9% lower error)**. Architectures optimized per route-task consistently yielded the best results compared to hand-designed baselines, demonstrating the benefit of customizing both model complexity and feature set to task-specific patterns in real-world transit systems. 
- **Skills:** Python, Tensorflow, Keras, Numpy, Scikit-learn
