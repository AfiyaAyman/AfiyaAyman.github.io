## üñ•Ô∏è Featured Projects

### 1. **Automated Multi-Task Machine Learning for Ridership Prediction of Public Transportation Routes**

[//]: # (- **Overview:** )
- Proposed an efficient affinity-driven MTL framework that pre-selects task groups to maximize MTL performance gains. 
- Proposed task-affinity‚Äìdriven grouping strategies, **improving MTL gain prediction accuracy**, and outperforming baseline MTL gain prediction methods (TAG, MTGNet, GRADTAE) by a wide margin, **achieving up to 4x higher correlation with ground-truth gains** across computer vision, tabular, time-series, and transportation benchmarks.
- Achieved **15% lower prediction error** than single-task models and **~7% MSE improvement over Naive baseline MTL**. Validated on real-world public transit ridership data, demonstrating consistent performance gains across task groups.

[//]: # (- **Overview:** )

[//]: # (  - Designed a predictive framework for optimizing energy consumption across various transit vehicle types. This system minimizes fuel and electricity use while enabling optimal vehicle-to-trip assignments and charging schedules.)
- Designed and developed a framework for predicting energy consumption for various transit vehicle types using multi-month sensor data, outperforming classic learning algorithms (decision trees and linear regression) by **~ 33% in MSE reduction**. 
- Achieved **<5% prediction error** for 6-hour trips, by aggregating sample-level predictions across time-series segments. 
- Built a decision tree‚Äìbased map-matching module linking noisy GPS to road geometry with **90% accuracy**, enabling elevation and distance features. 
- Models trained on multi-month, multi-vehicle telemetry data (6 vehicle types across 8 months); prediction outcomes informed energy-aware routing and scheduling strategies for transit agencies in Tennessee. 
- Integrated into a distributed ML pipeline for real-time energy prediction

### 3. **Neural Architecture and Feature Search for Predicting Public Transit Ridership** [Project Details](https://aronlaszka.com/project/ai-engine/)

[//]: # (- **Overview:**)
- Developed a neural architecture and feature search framework for route-specific ridership prediction using Automatic Passenger Count and weather data - **jointly optimizing prediction error and model complexity** 
- Evaluated on real-world transit ridership data across ten routes, showing that route-specific neural network architectures and features outperform generally optimized models in prediction accuracy **(9% lower error)**. 
- Architectures optimized per route-task consistently yielded the best results compared to hand-designed baselines, demonstrating the benefit of customizing both model complexity and feature set to task-specific patterns in real-world transit systems.
