I am a PhD candidate at The Pennsylvania State University in the College of Information Sciences and Technology. I am passionate about contemporary computational sciences, particularly automated machine learning (AutoML) and data science. As a Graduate Research Assistant working with Dr. Aron Laszka in the [Applied Artificial Intelligence Lab](https://aronlaszka.com/), I am thrilled to be part of a team pushing the boundaries of innovation in these fields.

Before joining Penn State, I completed my MS in Computer Science at the University of Houston in August 2022. I also earned my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering from Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology in Bangladesh.

My research focuses on advanced machine learning and AutoML techniques to address real-world challenges. For my PhD thesis, I am investigating factors influencing Multi-Task Learning (MTL) performance and designing a cost-effective affinity prediction strategy that leverages task relationships to optimize task grouping and maximize performance gains. Additionally, I have contributed to multiple NSF-funded projects, applying neural networks and other machine learning techniques to redesign the operational planning of regional transportation authorities, making them more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly. I am committed to combining computational methods with domain expertise to create a meaningful societal impact.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, hiking, traveling, and exploring new places. I also appreciate intellectually stimulating TV series and movies. Thank you for taking the time to learn a bit about me!
