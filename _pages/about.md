I am a PhD student at The Pennsylvania State University in the College of Information Sciences and Technology. I am passionate about contemporary computational sciences, particularly automated machine learning, and data science. As a Graduate Research Assistant working with Dr Aron Laszka, I am excited to be part of a team that is pushing the boundaries of what is possible in these areas.

Before joining PennState, I completed my MS in Computer Science from the University of Houston in August 2022. I also earned my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering from Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology in Bangladesh.

My current research focuses on applying neural networks and machine learning to restructure the operational planning of regional transportation authorities to be more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly. The combination of computational methods and domain expertise can profoundly impact society, and I am committed to making a positive contribution through my work.

When I have free time, I find pleasure in indulging in a variety of activities. I am an avid reader of books, with a particular interest in fiction. I also enjoy traveling to new places and taking walks to explore the outdoors. In addition, I like to watch TV series and movies that challenge me intellectually and offer food for thought. Thank you for taking the time to read a little bit about me!
