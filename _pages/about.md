I am a PhD student at The Pennsylvania State University in the College of Information Sciences and Technology. I am passionate about contemporary computational sciences, particularly automated machine learning, and data science. As a Graduate Research Assistant working with Dr Aron Laszka, I am excited to be part of a team that is pushing the boundaries of what is possible in these areas.

Before joining PennState, I completed my MS in Computer Science from the University of Houston in August 2022. I also earned my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering from Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology in Bangladesh.

My current research focuses on applying neural networks and machine learning to restructure the operational planning of regional transportation authorities to be more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly. The combination of computational methods and domain expertise can profoundly impact society, and I am committed to making a positive contribution through my work.

In my free time, I enjoy various activities such as reading books, traveling, taking walks and watching TV series and movies. I have a particular interest in fiction books and I like to explore new places outdoors. I also prefer intellectually stimulating TV series and movies. Thanks for taking the time to learn a bit about me!
