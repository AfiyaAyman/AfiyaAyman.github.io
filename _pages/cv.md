Professional Experience
======

**Research Assistant** â€” *Advisor: [Dr. Aron Laszka](https://aronlaszka.com/)*  
[The Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/), University Park, PA â€” **Aug 2022 â€“ Aug 2025**
- Advanced **multi-task learning (MTL)** research by developing task-affinityâ€“driven grouping strategies, improving gain prediction accuracy, and outperforming baseline MTL gain prediction methods by a wide margin, achieving up to **4x higher correlation with ground-truth gains** across computer vision, tabular, time-series, and transportation benchmarks.
- Designed scalable MTL training pipelines, including a two-stage ensemble model leveraging gradient dynamics to predict and optimize MTL performance.
- Applied automated MTL frameworks to real-world public transit forecasting, enabling data-driven decision support for high-impact transportation systems.

**Research Assistant**  
[University of Houston](https://www.uh.edu/), Houston, TX â€” **Jan 2019 â€“ Jul 2022**  
- Led DOE/NSF-funded ML research in **transportation, energy, and security**, producing multiple peer-reviewed publications and influencing transit operations. 
- Built ANN-based energy prediction models reducing MSE by 33%, developed NAS methods for ridership prediction (9% error reduction). 
- Conducted large-scale NLP and statistical analyses on cybersecurity datasets, uncovering behavioral and security patterns in smart contract development and bug bounty programs.

**Teaching Assistant** 
[The Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/) â€” **Spring 2025**  
- Assisted in instruction, grading, and student support for undergraduate programming course.

**Lecturer** â€” School of Science, Engineering & Technology,
[East Delta University](https://www.eastdelta.edu.bd/), Bangladesh â€” **September 2016 â€“ December 2018**
- Taught foundational CS and engineering courses, including Programming, Data Structures, Discrete Math, AI, and OS.
- Designed course materials and mentored students on research and programming competitions.
- Founded the EDU Computer Club, which regularly organized intra- and inter-university coding competitions.

**Software & Systems Development Experience**  

- Developed full-stack web and mobile applications (restaurant management, real estate listing, online examination systems) using CorePHP, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, and jQuery.
- Built ML-powered analytics pipelines integrating Python, PyTorch, and TensorFlow with large-scale sensor, GPS, and weather data for automated transit data processing and prediction.
