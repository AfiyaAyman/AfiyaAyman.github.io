Professional Experience
======
**Research Assistant** – *Advisor: [Dr. Aron Laszka](https://aronlaszka.com/)*  
[The Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/), University Park, PA — *Aug 2022 – Present*  
- Advanced multi-task learning (MTL) research by developing **task-affinity–driven grouping strategies**, improving gain prediction accuracy and outperforming state-of-the-art methods by ~7% across computer vision, tabular, time-series, and transportation benchmarks.  
- Designed a **two-stage ensemble model** leveraging gradient dynamics to predict MTL performance, enabling cost-effective optimization.  
- Applied automated MTL frameworks to **real-world public transit forecasting**, enabling data-driven decision support for high-impact transportation systems.  

**Research Assistant**  
[University of Houston](https://www.uh.edu/), Houston, TX — *Jan 2019 – Jul 2022*  
- Led DOE- and NSF-funded ML research in **transportation, energy, and security**, producing multiple peer-reviewed publications and influencing transit agency operations.  
- Built **ANN-based energy prediction frameworks** for electric and diesel fleets, reducing MSE by up to 33% vs. baselines and achieving <5% error for 6-hour trips, informing fleet scheduling and routing.  
- Developed **neural architecture search (NAS) methods** for transit ridership prediction, jointly optimizing accuracy and model complexity per task, achieving 9% error reduction over generally optimized models.  
- Conducted **large-scale NLP and statistical analyses** on cybersecurity datasets, uncovering behavioral and security patterns in smart contract development and bug bounty programs.  

**Software & Systems Development Experience**  
- Developed **full-stack web and mobile applications** (restaurant management, real estate listing, online examination systems) using CorePHP, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, and jQuery.  
- Built **ML-powered analytics pipelines** integrating Python, PyTorch, and TensorFlow with large-scale sensor, GPS, and weather data for automated transit data processing and prediction.  

**Teaching Assistant**  
[The Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/), University Park, PA — *Jan 2025 – May 2025*  
- Object-Oriented Programming (Spring 2025): Assisted in instruction, grading, and student support for undergraduate programming course.  

**Lecturer**  
[East Delta University](https://www.eastdelta.edu.bd/), Bangladesh — *Sep 2016 – Dec 2018*  
- Taught foundational CS and engineering courses, including Programming, Data Structures, Discrete Math, AI, and OS.  
- Designed course materials and mentored students on research projects and coding competitions.
